(18, 2, 11, 'When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: "Why, we are reformers."'),

(20, 2, 13, 'When asked to believe as others do, they say: "Should we believe like fools?" And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know.'),
(21, 2, 14, 'When they meet the faithful they say: "We believe;" but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: "We are really with you; we were joking."'),
(22, 2, 15, 'But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness.'),

(26, 2, 19, 'Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death. But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides.'),
(27, 2, 20, 'Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare. When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful.'),
(28, 2, 21, 'So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him'),

And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly.'),
(33, 2, 26, 'God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: "What does God mean by this parable?" He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,'),
(34, 2, 27, 'Who, having sealed it, break God\'s covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly.'),

(39, 2, 32, 'And they said: "Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise."'),
(40, 2, 33, 'Then He said to Adam: "Convey to them their names." And when he had told them, God said: "Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?"'),
(41, 2, 34, 'Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever.'),
(42, 2, 35, 'And We said to Adam: "Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors.'),

(56, 2, 49, 'Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh\'s people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord.'),
(57, 2, 50, 'Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes.'),
(58, 2, 51, 'Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong.'),
(59, 2, 52, 'Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful.'),
(60, 2, 53, 'Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided.'),
(61, 2, 54, 'Remember, Moses said: "My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord." And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful.'),
(62, 2, 55, 'Remember, when you said to Moses: "We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face," lightning struck you as you looked.'),
(63, 2, 56, 'Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;'),
(64, 2, 57, 'And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves.'),
(65, 2, 58, 'And remember, We said to you: "Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: \'May our sins be forgiven.\' We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance.'),
(66, 2, 59, 'But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed.'),
(67, 2, 60, 'And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking. Eat and drink, (enjoy) God\'s gifts, and spread no discord in the land.'),
(68, 2, 61, 'Remember, when you said: "O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;" he said: "Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask." So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled.'),
(69, 2, 62, 'Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret.'),
(70, 2, 63, 'Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed."'),
(71, 2, 64, 'But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost.'),
(72, 2, 65, 'You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: "Become (like) apes despised,"'),
(73, 2, 66, 'And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God.'),
(74, 2, 67, 'Remember, when Moses said to his people: "God demands that you sacrifice a cow," they said: "Are you making fun of us?" And he said: "God forbid that I be of the ignorant."'),
(75, 2, 68, '"Call on your Lord for us," they said, "that He might inform us what kind she should be." "Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between," answered Moses. "So do as you are bid."'),
(76, 2, 69, '"Call on your Lord," they said, "to tell us the colour of the cow." "God says," answered Moses, "a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye."'),
(77, 2, 70, '"Call on your Lord," they said, "to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us. If God wills we shall be guided aright."'),
(78, 2, 71, 'And Moses said: "He says it\'s a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish." "Now have you brought us the truth," they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow.'),
(79, 2, 72, 'Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed.'),
(80, 2, 73, 'We had pronounced already: "Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life)." Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand.'),
(81, 2, 74, 'Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God. And God is not negligent of all that you do.'),
(82, 2, 75, 'How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?'),
(83, 2, 76, 'For when they meet the faithful, they say: "We believe;" but when among themselves, they say: "Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord. Have you no sense indeed?"'),
(84, 2, 77, 'Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?'),
(85, 2, 78, 'Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies.'),
(86, 2, 79, 'But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: "This is from God," so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!'),
(87, 2, 80, 'Yet they say: "The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days." Say.. "Have you so received a promise from God?" "Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?"'),
(88, 2, 81, 'Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever.'),
(89, 2, 82, 'But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever.'),
(90, 2, 83, 'Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: "Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others)," you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed.'),
(91, 2, 84, 'And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too.'),
(92, 2, 85, 'But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do.'),
(93, 2, 86, 'They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them.'),
(94, 2, 87, 'Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace. Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew.'),
(95, 2, 88, 'And they say: "Our hearts are enfolded in covers." In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe.'),
(96, 2, 89, 'And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it. The curse of God be on those who deny!'),
(97, 2, 90, 'They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath. The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious.'),
(98, 2, 91, 'And when it is said to them: "believe in what God has sent down," they say: "We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter," although it affirms the truth they possess already. Say: "Why have you then been slaying God\'s apostles as of old, if you do believe?"'),
(99, 2, 92, 'Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed.'),
(100, 2, 93, 'Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) "Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed," you said: "We have heard and will not obey." (The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief. Say: "Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!"'),
(101, 2, 94, 'Tell them: "If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true."'),
(102, 2, 95, 'But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well.'),
(103, 2, 96, 'You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry. Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do.'),
(104, 2, 97, 'Say: "Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --'),
(105, 2, 98, 'Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers."'),
(106, 2, 99, 'We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth.'),
(107, 2, 100, 'And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe.'),
(108, 2, 101, 'When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it.'),
(109, 2, 102, 'And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: "We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith)." They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife. Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God. And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain. They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!'),
(110, 2, 103, 'Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!'),
(111, 2, 104, 'Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: "Have regard for us (ra\'ina)," but "look at us (unzurna)," and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers.'),
(112, 2, 105, 'Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite.'),
(113, 2, 106, 'When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things?'),
(114, 2, 107, 'Do you not know that God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?'),
(115, 2, 108, 'Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past? But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path.'),
(116, 2, 109, 'How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them! But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things.'),
(117, 2, 110, 'Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat. And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill.'),
(118, 2, 111, 'And they say: "None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;" but this is only wishful thinking. Say: "Bring the proof if you are truthful."'),
(119, 2, 112, 'Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret.'),
(120, 2, 113, 'The Jews say: "The Christians are not right," and the Christians say: "The Jews are in the wrong;" yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too. God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning.'),
(121, 2, 114, 'And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence? For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come.'),
(122, 2, 115, 'To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing.'),
(123, 2, 116, 'Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God.'),
(124, 2, 117, 'Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: "Be", and it is.'),
(125, 2, 118, 'But those who are ignorant say: "Why does God not speak or show us a sign?" The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts. But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already.'),
(126, 2, 119, 'And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell.'),
(127, 2, 120, 'The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: "God\'s guidance alone is true guidance;" for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you.'),
(128, 2, 121, 'Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers.'),
(129, 2, 122, 'O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world.'),
(130, 2, 123, 'Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach.'),
(131, 2, 124, 'Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: "I will make you a leader among men." And when Abraham asked: "From my progeny too?" the Lord said: "My pledge does not include transgressors."'),
(132, 2, 125, 'Remember, We made the House (of Ka\'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: "Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;" and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration.'),
(133, 2, 126, 'And when Abraham said: "O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food," He answered: "To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!"'),
(134, 2, 127, 'And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): "Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;'),
(135, 2, 128, 'And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;'),
(136, 2, 129, 'And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise.'),
(137, 2, 130, 'Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,'),
(138, 2, 131, '(For) when his Lord said to him: "Obey," he replied: "I submit to the Lord of all the worlds."'),
(139, 2, 132, 'And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: "O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God)."'),
(140, 2, 133, 'Were you present at the hour of Jacob\'s death? "What will you worship after me?" he asked his sons, and they answered: "We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit."'),
(141, 2, 134, 'Those were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds.'),
(142, 2, 135, 'They say: "Become Jews or become Christians, and find the right way." Say: "No. We follow the way of Abraham the upright, who was not an idolater."'),
(143, 2, 136, 'Say: "We believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and what had been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their progeny, and that which was given to Moses and Christ, and to all other prophets by the Lord. We make no distinction among them, and we submit to Him."'),
(144, 2, 137, 'If they come to believe as you did, they will find the right path. If they turn away then they will only oppose; but God will suffice you against them, for God hears all and knows everything.'),

When you have security, then those of you who wish to perform the holy visit along with the pilgrimage, should make a sacrifice according to their means.

But a greater sin in the eyes of God is to hinder people from the way of God, and not to believe in Him, and to bar access to the Holy Mosque and turn people out of its precincts; and oppression is worse than killing. They will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith, if they can.

(235, 2, 228, 'Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods, and if they believe in God and the Last Day they must not hide unlawfully what God has formed within their wombs. Their husbands would do well to take them back in that case, if they wish to be reconciled. Women also have recognised rights as men have, though men have an edge over them.

(236, 2, 229, 'Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself. Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors.'),
(237, 2, 230, 'If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man.

He who does so will wrong himself. Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong. Have fear of God, and remember, God is cognisant of everything.'),
(239, 2, 232, 'When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably. This warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day. This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know.'),
(240, 2, 233, 'The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring. The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies). If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm. And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary. But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.'),
(241, 2, 234, 'Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands death) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably, for God is aware of all that you do.'),

Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing.'),
(243, 2, 236, 'There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.'),
(244, 2, 237, 'And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount. And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety. But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do.'),

(252, 2, 245, 'Who will give a goodly loan to God which He might double many times? For God withholds and enlarges, and to Him you will return.'),
(253, 2, 246, 'Have you thought of the elders of Israel after Moses, and how they said to their apostle: "Set up a king for us, then we shall fight in the way of God?" He replied: "This too is possible that when commanded to fight you may not fight at all." They said: "How is it we should not fight in the way of God when we have been driven from our homes and deprived of our Sons?" But when they were ordered to fight they turned away, except for a few; yet God knows the sinners.'),
(254, 2, 247, 'And when their prophet said to them: "God has raised Saul king over you," they said: "How can he be king over us when we have greater right to kingship than he, for he does not even possess abundant wealth?" "God has chosen him in preference to you," said the prophet "and given him much more wisdom and prowess; and God gives authority to whomsoever He will: God is infinite and all-wise."'),
(255, 2, 248, 'Their prophet said to them: "The sign of his kingship will be that you will come to have a heart full of peace and tranquility from your Lord and the legacy left by Moses\' and Aaron\'s family supported by angels. This shall be a token for you if you really believe."'),

The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands." And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: "We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: "Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere)."'),
(257, 2, 250, 'And when they were facing Goliath and his hordes they prayed: "O Lord, give us endurance and steady our steps, and help us against the deniers of truth."'),
(258, 2, 251, 'By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased. If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved. But gracious is God to the people of the world.'),

(260, 2, 253, 'Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others. God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others. And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them. But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied. And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves. But God does whatsoever He please.'),
(261, 2, 254, 'O believers, expend of what We have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter, and no friendship or intercession matter, and those who are disbelievers will be sinners.'),
(262, 2, 255, 'God: There is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining. Neither does somnolence affect Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: and who can intercede with Him except by His leave? Known to Him is all that is present before men and what is hidden (in time past and time future), and not even a little of His knowledge can they grasp except what He will. His seat extends over heavens and the earth, and He tires not protecting them: He alone is all high and supreme.'),
(263, 2, 256, 'There is no compulsion in matter of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error. He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything.'),
(264, 2, 257, 'God is the friend of those who believe, and leads them out of darkness into light; but the patrons of infidels are idols and devils who lead them from light into darkness. They are the residents of Hell, and will there for ever abide.'),
(265, 2, 258, 'Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: "My Lord is the giver of life and death," he replied: "I am the giver of life and death." And Abraham said: "God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West," and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust.'),
(266, 2, 259, 'Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down. He said: "How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?" So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: "How long did you stay in this state?" "A day or less than a day," he replied. "No," He said, "you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh." When this became clear to him, the man said: "Indeed God has power over all things."'),
(267, 2, 260, 'Remember, when Abraham said: "O Lord, show me how you raise the dead," He said: "What! Do you not believe?" "I do," answered Abraham. "I only ask for my heart\'s assurance." (The Lord) said: "Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you. Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise."'),
(268, 2, 261, 'The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise.'),
(269, 2, 262, 'Those who spend in the way of God, and having spent do not boast or give pain (by word or deed), will get their reward from their Lord, and will neither have fear nor regret.'),
(270, 2, 263, 'Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind.'),
(271, 2, 264, 'O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day. His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare. So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe.'),
(272, 2, 265, 'But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do.'),
(273, 2, 266, 'Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect.'),
(274, 2, 267, 'O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy.'),
(275, 2, 268, 'Satan threatens you with want, and orders you (to commit) shameful acts. But God promises His pardon and grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing.'),
(276, 2, 269, 'He gives wisdom to whomsoever He please; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance. Yet none remembers this save men of wisdom.'),
(277, 2, 270, 'Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them.'),
(278, 2, 271, 'If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do.'),
(279, 2, 272, 'It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you.'),
(280, 2, 273, '(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend.'),
(281, 2, 274, 'Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret.'),
(282, 2, 275, 'Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever.'),
(283, 2, 276, 'God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners.'),
(284, 2, 277, 'Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret.'),
(285, 2, 278, 'O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe.'),
(286, 2, 279, 'If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle. But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you.'),
(287, 2, 280, 'If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand.'),
(288, 2, 281, 'Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged.'),
(289, 2, 282, 'O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything.'),
(290, 2, 283, 'If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do.'),
(291, 2, 284, 'To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things.'),
(292, 2, 285, 'The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles. For they say: "We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end."'),
(293, 2, 286, 'God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers.');

Say: "All affairs rest with God." They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say: "If we had a say in the affair we would not have been killed in this place." Tell them: "Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest. God had to try them to bring out what they concealed in their breasts, and to bring out the secrets of their hearts, for God knows your innermost thoughts.'),
(448, 3, 155, 'All those among you who turned their backs on the day the two armies clashed (at \'Uhud) were surely induced by Satan to fail in their duty because of their sinful deeds. But God has already forgiven them, for God is forgiving and kind.'),
(449, 3, 156, 'O you who believe, do not be like those who deny, and say of their brethren (who died) travelling in the land or fighting: "Had they stayed with us here they would not have died or been killed."

(455, 3, 162, 'Is a man who has followed the pleasure of God the same as he who has incurred His wrath, whose abode is surely Hell, a dreadful place?'),
(456, 3, 163, 'There are different ranks with God, And God sees everything you do.'),
(457, 3, 164, 'God has favoured the faithful by sending an apostle to them from among themselves, who recites to them His messages, and reforms and teaches them the Law and the judgement, for they were clearly in error before.'),
(458, 3, 165, 'How is it that when misfortune befell you, you said: "Where has this come from?" -- even though you had inflicted disaster twice as great on (the enemy). Say: "This has come from your own selves." Surely God has power over all things.'),
(459, 3, 166, 'What you suffered on the day the two armies had met was by God\'s dispensation, so that He may distinguish the faithful,'),
(460, 3, 167, 'And may distinguish the hypocrites who were told: "Fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves," and who had replied: "If we knew of the fight we would have followed you."

(467, 3, 174, 'And returned with God\'s favour and grace without harm, for they attended the pleasure of God; and great is the benevolence of God.'),
(468, 3, 175, 'It is no one but Satan who frightens you with his allies. But do not fear him, fear Me, if indeed you are believers.'),

(472, 3, 179, 'God will not leave the believers in the state they are in till He has sifted the evil from the good; nor will God reveal the secrets of the Unknown. He chooses (for this) from His apostles whom He will. So believe in God and the prophets, for if you believe and fear the displeasure of God your reward will be great.'),
(473, 3, 180, 'Let not those who are niggardly of things that God has given them of His largesse think that this is good for them. In fact, it is worse; for what they grudged will be hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. To God belong the heavens and the earth, and God is aware of all you do.'),
(474, 3, 181, 'God has indeed heard the words of those who said: "God is a pauper whereas we are rich." We shall make a note of their words, and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly, and say to them: "Now taste the agony of burning."'),

(476, 3, 183, 'To those who say: "God has ordained that we should not believe an apostle who does not bring burnt offerings," say: "Many an apostle had come to you before me with manifest proofs, even with what you mention; then why did you kill them if you were men of truth?"'),
(477, 3, 184, 'If they call you a liar (remember) so had other apostles been called before you, who had come with clear signs and Scriptures and the Book enlightening.'),
(478, 3, 185, 'Every soul will know the taste of death. You will get your recompense in full on the Day of Resurrection; and he who is spared the Fire and finds his way to Paradise will meet his desire. As for the life of this world, it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity.'),
(479, 3, 186, 'You will, nonetheless, be tried with your wealth and life, and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former Books and the infidels. But if you endure with patience and follow the straight path, it will surely (accord) with God\'s fixed resolve about human affairs.'),
(480, 3, 187, 'And remember when God took a promise from the people of the Book to make its (truth) known to mankind, and not keep back any part of it, they set aside (the pledge), and sold it away for a little gain but how wretched the bargain that they made!'),
(481, 3, 188, 'Think not that those who exult at what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape the punishment, for grievous indeed will be their doom.'),

(485, 3, 192, 'Whoever, O Lord, should be cast into Hell shall be verily disgraced; and the sinners shall have none to help (or save) them.'),
(486, 3, 193, 'We have heard, O our Lord, the crier call inviting us to faith (and announcing): \'Believe in your Lord.\' O our Lord, to faith we have come, so forgive our trespasses, deliver us from sin, and grant us (the glory of) death with the just.'),

(488, 3, 195, 'The Lord heard their prayer and answered: "I suffer not the good deeds of any to go waste, be he a man or a woman: The one of you is of the other. And those who were deprived of their homes or banished in My cause, and who fought and were killed, I shall blot out their sins and admit them indeed into gardens with rippling streams." -- A recompense from God, and the best of rewards is with God.'),

(492, 3, 199, 'Certainly among the people of the Book are some who believe in God and in what has been revealed to you and had been revealed to them; and they bow in humility before God, and do not trade for paltry gain the signs of God. Their reward is verily with their Lord; and swift is the reckoning of God!'),
(493, 3, 200, 'So you who believe, have endurance in suffering, be patient and persevere, strengthen each other and be firm, and be pious and fear God that you may find success.');

Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower.

(527, 4, 34, 'Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing). If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them. Surely God is sublime and great.'),

(585, 4, 92, 'It is not for a believer to take a believer\'s life except by mistake; and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a slave who is a believer, and pay blood-money to the victim\'s family unless they forego it as an act of charity. If he belonged to a community hostile to you but was himself a believer, then a slave who is a believer should be freed. In case he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then give blood-money to his family and free a believing slave.

(587, 4, 94, 'O believers, when you go out on a journey in the way of God, be discreet and do not say to anyone who greets you in peace: "You are not a believer." You desire the gain of earthly life, but there are prizes in plenty with God. You were also like him (an unbeliever) in the past, but God has been gracious to you. So be careful and discreet, for God is aware of what you do.'),
(588, 4, 95, 'The faithful who sit idle, other than those who are disabled, are not equal to those who fight in the way of God with their wealth and lives. God has exalted those in rank who fight for the faith with their wealth and souls over those who sit idle. Though God\'s promise of good is for all, He has granted His favour of the highest reward to those who struggle in preference to those who sit at home.'),

(595, 4, 102, 'When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms. After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares. It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions. God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment'),
(596, 4, 103, 'If you are late in performing your service of prayer honour God by remembering Him, standing or sitting or lying on your sides. And when you have security perform your act of prayer befittingly; and praying at fixed hours is prescribed for the faithful.'),

(655, 4, 162, 'But to the learned among them, and the believers who affirm what has been revealed to you and was revealed to those before you, and to those who fulfil their devotional obligations, who pay the zakat and believe in God and the Last Day, We shall give a great reward.'),
(656, 4, 163, 'We have sent revelations to you as We sent revelations to Noah and the prophets (who came) after him; and We sent revelations to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob, and their offspring, and to Jesus and Job, and to Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and to David We gave the Book of Psalms,'),
(657, 4, 164, 'And to many an apostle We have mentioned before, and to many other apostles We have not mentioned to you; and to Moses God spoke directly.'),
(658, 4, 165, 'All these apostles of good news and admonition were sent so that after the apostles men may have no argument against God. God is all-powerful and all-wise.'),
(659, 4, 166, 'God is Himself witness to what has been revealed to you, and revealed with His knowledge, and the angels are witness; and God is sufficient as witness.'),
(660, 4, 167, 'Those who denied and turned away from the path of God, have wandered far astray.'),
(661, 4, 168, 'Those who deny and transgress will not be forgiven by God, nor be shown the way'),
(662, 4, 169, 'Except to Hell, where they will abide for ever; and this is how (the law of God) works inevitably.'),
(663, 4, 170, 'O men, the Apostle has now come to you, bringing the truth from your Lord; so believe for your own good; but if you deny (then remember) that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(664, 4, 171, 'O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him. So believe in God and His apostles, and do not call Him \'Trinity\'. Abstain from this for your own good; for God is only one God, and far from His glory is it to beget a son. All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and sufficient is God for all help.'),
(665, 4, 172, 'The Christ will never disdain to be a votary of God, nor will the angels close to Him. And those who disdain to serve Him and are proud (should remember) that they will all go back to Him in the end.'),
(666, 4, 173, 'Then those who believed and earned good deeds will be given their recompense in full, and even more out of grace. But those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment. They will find none except God to help them or save them.'),
(667, 4, 174, 'O men, you have received infallible proof from your Lord, and We have sent down a beacon light to you.'),
(668, 4, 175, 'So those who believe in God and hold fast to Him shall indeed be received into His mercy and His grace, and be guided to Him the straight path.'),
(669, 4, 176, 'They ask you for judgement about \'Kalalah\' (a man who dies childless). Say: "God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance." If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything.');

(670, 5, 1, 'O YOU WHO believe, fulfil your obligations. Made lawful (as food) for you are animals except those mentioned (here); but unlawful during Pilgrimage is game. God ordains whatsoever He wills.'),
(671, 5, 2, 'O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka\'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure. Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.'),
(672, 5, 3, 'Forbidden you is carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and whatsoever has been killed in the name of some other than God, and whatever has been strangled, or killed by a blow or a fall, or by goring, or that which has been mauled by wild beasts unless slaughtered while still alive; and that which has been slaughtered at altars is forbidden, and also dividing the meat by casting lots with arrows. All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you. If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind.'),
(673, 5, 4, 'They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: "All things are lawful for you that are clean, and what the trained hunting animals take for you as you have trained then, in the light of God\'s teachings, but read over them the name of God, and fear (straying from the path of) God, for God is swift in the reckoning."'),
(674, 5, 5, 'On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come.'),
(675, 5, 6, 'O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you. He wishes to purify you, and grace you with His favours in full so that you may be grateful.'),
(676, 5, 7, 'Remember the favours He bestowed on you, and the covenant He cemented with you, when you said: "We have heard and obey." Have fear of God, for He knows the secrets of your heart.'),
(677, 5, 8, 'O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God. Surely God is aware of all you do.'),
(678, 5, 9, 'God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds.'),
(679, 5, 10, 'But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the people of Hell.'),
(680, 5, 11, 'O believers, remember the favours God bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and He restrained their hands. So fear God; and the faithful should place their trust in God.'),
(681, 5, 12, 'God covenanted the people of Israel and raised twelve leaders among them, and said: "I shall verily be with you. If you fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat and believe in My apostles and support them, and give a goodly loan to God, I shall certainly absolve you of your evil, and admit you to gardens with streams of running water. But whosoever among you denies after this, will have wandered away from the right path."'),
(682, 5, 13, 'When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts. So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against. You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few. But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good.'),
(683, 5, 14, 'We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing.'),
(684, 5, 15, 'O people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you, announcing many things of the Scriptures that you have suppressed, passing over some others. To you has come light and a clear Book from God'),
(685, 5, 16, 'Through which God will lead those who follow His pleasure to the path of peace, and guide them out of darkness into light by His will, and to the path that is straight.'),
(686, 5, 17, 'Verily they are unbelievers who say: "The Messiah, son of Mary, is God." You ask them: "Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?" For God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things.'),
(687, 5, 18, 'Say the Jews and the Christians: "We are sons of God and beloved of Him." Say: "Why does He punish you then for your sins? No: You are only mortals, of His creation." He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him.'),
(688, 5, 19, 'O you people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: "There did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings." So now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for God has the power over all things.'),
(689, 5, 20, 'Remember when Moses said to his people: "O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world.'),
(690, 5, 21, 'Enter then, my people, the Holy Land that God has ordained for you, and do not turn back, or you will suffer."'),
(691, 5, 22, 'They said: "O Moses, in that land live a people who are formidable; we shall never go there until they leave. We shall enter when they go away."'),
(692, 5, 23, 'Then two of the men who feared (God), and to whom God was gracious, said to them: "Charge and rush the gate. If you enter, you will surely be victorious. And place your trust in God if you truly believe."'),
(693, 5, 24, 'They said: "O Moses, we shall never, never enter so long as they are there. Go you and your Lord to fight them; we stay here."'),
(694, 5, 25, 'Said (Moses): "O Lord, I have control over none but myself and my brother; so distinguish between us and these, the wicked people."'),
(695, 5, 26, '(And God) said: "Then verily this land is forbidden them for forty years, and they shall wander perplexed over the earth. So do not grieve for these, the wicked people."'),
(696, 5, 27, 'Narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of Adam. When each of them offered a sacrifice (to God), that of one was accepted, and that of the other was not. Said (the one): "I will murder you," and the other replied: "God only accepts from those who are upright and preserve themselves from evil.'),
(697, 5, 28, 'If you raise your hand to kill me, I will raise not mine to kill you, for I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds;'),
(698, 5, 29, 'I would rather you suffered the punishment for sinning against me, and for your own sin, and became an inmate of Hell. And that is the requital for the unjust."'),
(699, 5, 30, 'Then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother, and he killed him, and became one of the damned.'),
(700, 5, 31, 'Then God sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how to hide the nakedness of his brother. "Alas, the woe," said he, "that I could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother," and was filled with remorse.'),
(701, 5, 32, 'That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race. Our apostles brought clear proofs to them; but even after that most of them committed excesses in the land.'),
(702, 5, 33, 'The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and perpetrate disorders in the land, is to kill or hang them, or have a hand on one side and a foot on the other cut off, or banish them from the land. Such is their disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter their doom shall be dreadful.'),
(703, 5, 34, 'But those who repent before they are subdued should know that God is forgiving and kind.'),
(704, 5, 35, 'O you who believe, follow the path shown to you by God, and seek the way of proximity to Him, and struggle in His way: you may have success.'),
(705, 5, 36, 'As for unbelievers, if they possess the riches of the whole earth, and two times more, and offer it as ransom for release from the torments of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and their punishment will surely be painful.'),
(706, 5, 37, 'They would like to escape from the Fire, but will never succeed, and their suffering will be constant'),
(707, 5, 38, 'As for the thief, whether man or woman, cut his hand as punishment from God for what he had done; and God is all mighty and all wise.'),
(708, 5, 39, 'But those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God, for God is forgiving and kind.'),
(709, 5, 40, 'Do you not know that God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will, and pardons whom He please, for God has the power over all things.'),
(710, 5, 41, 'Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: "We believe," but do not believe in their hearts. And those of the Jews who listen to tell lies, and spy on behalf of others who do not come to you, and who distort the words (of the Torah) out of context, and say: "If you are given (what we say is true) accept it; but if you are not given it, beware." You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way. These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify. For them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next --'),
(711, 5, 42, 'Eavesdropping for telling lies, earning through unlawful means! So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline. And if you decline, they can do you no harm; but if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just.'),
(712, 5, 43, 'But why should they make you a judge when the Torah is with them which contains the Law of God? Even then they turn away. They are those who will never believe.'),
(713, 5, 44, 'We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God\'s writ. So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by God\'s revelations are infidels indeed.'),
(714, 5, 45, 'And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God\'s revelations are unjust.'),
(715, 5, 46, 'Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path.'),
(716, 5, 47, 'Let the people of the Gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by God. And those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are transgressors.'),
(717, 5, 48, 'And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance.'),
(718, 5, 49, 'Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God. If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors.'),
(719, 5, 50, 'Do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance? But who could be a better judge than God for those who are firm in their faith?'),
(720, 5, 51, 'O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.'),
(721, 5, 52, 'You will notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness (of doubt) only hasten to join them and say: "We fear lest misfortune should surround us." It may well be that God may soon send (you) success, or other command of His. Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts.'),
(722, 5, 53, 'Then the believers will say: "Are these the people who had sworn by God on solemn oath and said: "We are surely with you?" Wasted have been all their deeds, and losers they remain.'),
(723, 5, 54, 'O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer. Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing.'),
(724, 5, 55, 'Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion, who pay the zakat and bow in homage (before God).'),
(725, 5, 56, 'And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious.'),
(726, 5, 57, 'O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;'),
(727, 5, 58, '(Nor make friends with) those who, when you call (the faithful) to prayer, make mock of it and jest, because they do not understand.'),
(728, 5, 59, 'Say to them: "O people of the Book, what reason have you for disliking us other than that we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?"'),
(729, 5, 60, 'Say: "Shall I inform you who will receive the worst chastisement from God? They who were condemned by God, and on whom fell His wrath, and those who were turned to apes and swine, and those who worship the powers of evil. They are in the worse gradation, and farthest away from the right path."'),
(730, 5, 61, 'When they come to you they say: "We believe;" but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go; and God is aware of what they conceal in their hearts.'),
(731, 5, 62, 'You will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness, and devour unlawful gain. How evil are the things they do!'),
(732, 5, 63, 'Why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain? Evil are the acts they commit!'),
(733, 5, 64, 'The Jews say: "Bound are the hands of God." Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say! In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt.'),
(734, 5, 65, 'If the people of the Book had believed and feared, We would surely have absolved them of their sins, and admitted them to gardens of delight.'),
(735, 5, 66, 'And if they had followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them by their Lord, they would surely have enjoyed (blessings) from the heavens above and the earth below their feet.'),
(736, 5, 67, 'Some among them are moderate, but evil is what most of them do! O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message. God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe.'),
(737, 5, 68, 'Say to them: "O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord." But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe.'),
(738, 5, 69, 'All those who believe, and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, in fact any one who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, will have nothing to fear or regret.'),
(739, 5, 70, 'We had taken a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers to them; but whenever an apostle came to them bringing what did not suit their mood, they called one imposter, another they slew,'),
(740, 5, 71, 'And imagined that no trials would befall them; and they turned deaf and blind (to the truth). But God still turned to them; yet many of them turned blind and deaf again; but God sees everything they do.'),
(741, 5, 72, 'They are surely infidels who say: "God is the Christ, son of Mary." But the Christ had only said: "O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord." Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them.'),
(742, 5, 73, 'Disbelievers are they surely who say: "God is the third of the trinity;" but there is no god other than God the one. And if they do not desist from saying what they say, then indeed those among them who persist in disbelief will suffer painful punishment.'),
(743, 5, 74, 'Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness? God is forgiving and kind.'),
(744, 5, 75, 'The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle, and many apostles had (come and) gone before him; and his mother was a woman of truth. They both ate the (same) food (as men). Behold, how We show men clear signs, and behold, how they wander astray!'),
(745, 5, 76, 'Tell them: "Leaving God aside, will you worship something that has no power over your loss or gain?" But God is all-hearing and all-knowing.'),
(746, 5, 77, 'Tell them: "O people of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs, and follow not the wishes of a people who had erred before, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the right path."'),
(747, 5, 78, 'Cursed were disbelievers among the children of Israel by David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they rebelled and transgressed the bounds.'),
(748, 5, 79, 'They did not restrain one another from the wicked things they used to do; and vile were the things that they were doing!'),
(749, 5, 80, 'You can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels. Vile it was what they sent ahead of them, so that God\'s indignation came upon them; and torment will they suffer an eternity.'),
(750, 5, 81, 'If they had believed in God and the Prophet and what had been revealed to him, they would never have held them as allies; and many among them are transgressors.'),
(751, 5, 82, 'You will find the Jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe; and the closest in love to the faithful are the people who say: "We are the followers of Christ," because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant.'),
(752, 5, 83, 'For when they listen to what has been revealed to this Apostle, you can see their eyes brim over with tears at the truth which they recognise, and say: "O Lord, we believe; put us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).'),
(753, 5, 84, 'And why should we not believe in God and what has come down to us of the truth? And we hope to be admitted by our Lord among those who are upright and do good?"'),
(754, 5, 85, 'God will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by, where they will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who do good.'),
(755, 5, 86, 'But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are residents of Hell.'),
(756, 5, 87, 'O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress. God does not love transgressors.'),
(757, 5, 88, 'Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe.'),
(758, 5, 89, 'God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths. Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful.'),
(759, 5, 90, 'O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper.'),
(760, 5, 91, 'Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?'),
(761, 5, 92, 'Obey God and the Prophet, and beware. If you turn away, remember, that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning.'),
(762, 5, 93, 'Those who believe and perform good deeds will not be held guilty for what they have eaten (in the past) if they fear God and believe, and do good things and are conscious (of God) and believe, and still fear and do good, for God loves those who do good.'),
(763, 5, 94, 'O you who believe, God will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances, in order to know who fear Him unseen. Whosoever transgress after this will suffer grievous punishment.'),
(764, 5, 95, 'O you who believe, do not kill game when you are on pilgrimage. And anyone among you who does so on purpose should offer livestock of equivalent value, determined by two honourable persons among you, (as atonement), to be brought to the Ka\'bah as an offering; or else expiate by giving food to the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may realise the gravity of his deed. God has forgiven what has happened in the past; but any one who does so again will be punished by God. And God is severe in requital.'),
(765, 5, 96, 'Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage. Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end.'),
(766, 5, 97, 'God has made the Ka\'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything.'),
(767, 5, 98, 'Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind.'),
(768, 5, 99, 'It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide.'),
(769, 5, 100, 'Tell them: "The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you." So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success.'),
(770, 5, 101, 'O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur\'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing.'),

(775, 5, 106, 'O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: "We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful."'),
(776, 5, 107, 'If it transpires they have concealed the truth, two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and swear by God: "Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have stated no more (than the truth), or else we shall be unjust"'),

(785, 5, 116, 'And when God will ask: "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: \'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?\' (Jesus) will answer: "Halleluja. Could I say what I knew I had no right (to say)? Had I said it You would surely have known, for You know what is in my heart though I know not what You have. You alone know the secrets unknown.'),
(786, 5, 117, 'I said nought to them but what You commanded me: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And so long as I dwelt with them I was witness over their actions. And after my life had been done, You were their keeper; and You are a witness over all things.'),
(787, 5, 118, 'If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise."'),
(788, 5, 119, 'God will say: \'This is the day when the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them will be gardens with streams running by, where they will for ever abide." God will accept them, and they will be gratified in (obeying) Him. This will surely be happiness supreme.'),
(789, 5, 120, 'To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and His the power over everything.');

(907, 6, 118, 'Eat only that over which the name of God has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His commands.'),
(908, 6, 119, 'And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors.'),
(909, 6, 120, 'Discard both the visible and invisible sin. For those who sin will be punished for what they have done.'),
(910, 6, 121, 'Do not eat of that over which God\'s name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater.'),
(911, 6, 122, 'Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers.'),
(912, 6, 123, 'And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know.'),
(913, 6, 124, 'Every time a sign comes to them they say: "We shall never believe till what God\'s apostles had been given comes to us." God knows best where to direct His messages. A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving.'),
(914, 6, 125, 'Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe.'),
(915, 6, 126, 'This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.'),
(916, 6, 127, 'For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their defender as reward for what they did.'),
(917, 6, 128, 'On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) "O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men." But their proteges among men will say: "O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us." "Your abode is Hell," He will say, "where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise." Verily your Lord is wise and all-knowing.'),
(918, 6, 129, 'Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds.'),
(919, 6, 130, 'O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)?" They will answer: "We bear witness to our sins." They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers.'),
(920, 6, 131, 'And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.'),
(921, 6, 132, 'Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do.'),
(922, 6, 133, 'Your Lord is all-sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others.'),
(923, 6, 134, 'The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.'),
(924, 6, 135, 'Tell them: "O my people, go on acting on your part, I am acting on mine. You will soon know whose is the guerdon of life to come." The wicked will not succeed.'),
(925, 6, 136, 'They allocate a share from God\'s own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: "This is God\'s" -- or so they think -- "and that, of the compeers of God," so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God\'s may reach the compeers (set up by them). How bad is the judgement that they make!'),
(926, 6, 137, 'In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith. If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods.'),
(927, 6, 138, 'They also say: "These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit," -- so they assert. "And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden." They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate.'),
(928, 6, 139, 'And they say: "Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still-born both could eat it." God will punish them for what they assert. He is all-wise and all-knowing.'),
(929, 6, 140, 'They will surely perish who kill their offspring in ignorance foolhardily, and forbid the food that God has given them by fabricating lies against God. Misguided are they surely, and will never come to guidance.'),
(930, 6, 141, 'It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike. So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal.'),
(931, 6, 142, 'He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter. So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy.'),
(932, 6, 143, 'There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats. Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs? Produce the sanction if you are truthful.'),
(933, 6, 144, 'And there are two of camels and two of oxen. Ask them: "Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?" Were you present at the time God issued this command?" Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants.'),
(934, 6, 145, 'You tell them: "In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane. But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind."'),
(935, 6, 146, 'We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true.'),
(936, 6, 147, 'If they call you a liar, tell them infinite is the mercy of your Lord; but His vengeance will not be turned back from the sinners.'),
(937, 6, 148, 'But the idolaters say: "If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing." So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end. Ask them: "Have you any knowledge? Then display it. You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars."'),
(938, 6, 149, 'Say: "To God belongs the consummate argument. Had He willed He would surely have guided all of you aright."'),
(939, 6, 150, 'Tell them: "Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this)." Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord.'),
(940, 6, 151, 'Tell them: "Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.'),
(941, 6, 152, 'Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed.'),
(942, 6, 153, '(He has further commanded:) \'This is My straight path, so walk along it, and do not follow other ways, lest you should turn away from the right one.\' All this has He commanded. You may perhaps take heed for yourselves."'),
(943, 6, 154, 'To that end We gave the Book to Moses, a perfect law, distinctly explaining all things, and a guidance and grace, so that they should believe in the meeting with their Lord.'),
(944, 6, 155, 'Blessed is this Book We have revealed; so follow it and preserve yourself from evil that you may qualify for grace,'),
(945, 6, 156, 'Lest you say: "The Book that was sent before was meant only for two groups; we were not aware of their teachings;"'),
(946, 6, 157, 'Or that: "Had the Book been sent down to us we would surely have been guided better than they." So you have now received from your Lord a clear proof and a guidance and grace. Then who is more wicked than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall punish those severely who turn away: A requital indeed for having turned aside.'),
(947, 6, 158, 'What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord? The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith. Tell them: "Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct)."'),
(948, 6, 159, 'As for those who have created schisms in their order, and formed different sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is with God. He will tell them the truth of what they were doing.'),
(949, 6, 160, 'He who does a good deed will receive ten times its worth; and he who does evil will be requited to an equal degree; and no one will be wronged.'),
(950, 6, 161, 'Tell them: "My Lord has directed me to a path that is straight, a supreme law, the creed of Abraham the upright who was not an idolater."'),
(951, 6, 162, 'Tell them: "My service and sacrifice, my life and my death, are all of them for God, the creator and Lord of all the worlds.'),
(952, 6, 163, 'No equal has He, I am commanded (to declare), and that I am the first to submit."'),
(953, 6, 164, 'Say: "Shall I search for another lord apart from God when He is the only Lord of all and everything?" Each soul earns (what it earns) for itself, and no man shall bear another\'s burden. You have to go back to your Lord in the end when He will tell you about the things you disputed.'),
(954, 6, 165, 'It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord\'s retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.');

For God has the power to do any thing.'),
(1202, 8, 42, '(That day) when you were at one end of the valley, (the unbelievers) at the other, and the caravan below you (on the lowland by the coast), you would surely have declined to fight if (the Makkans) had offered you battle. (But the battle did take place) that God may end the matter which had been accomplished, so that he who had to die may perish after a clear demonstration, and he who had to live may survive in the light of positive proof, for God hears all and knows everything.'),
(1203, 8, 43, 'God showed (the Makkans) to be few in your dream, for if He had shown them to be many you would surely have lost courage and disagreed about the (wisdom) of the battle. But God spared you this, for He surely knows what is in the hearts of men.'),

(1209, 8, 49, 'The hypocrites, and those who had doubts in their hearts, said: "Their faith has misled them." But whoever places his trust in God will find God mighty and wise.'),
(1210, 8, 50, 'If you could only see the infidels as the angels draw away their souls and strike their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the torment of burning'),
(1211, 8, 51, 'For what you have brought upon yourselves." God is surely not unjust to His creatures, (they are unjust to themselves).'),
(1212, 8, 52, 'Their case is like that of Pharaoh\'s people, and of those before them, who denied the revelations of God, and were punished for their sins by God, and God is all powerful and Severe His punishment.'),
(1213, 8, 53, 'God does not withdraw a favour bestowed upon a people unless they change themselves, for God hears all and knows everything.'),
(1214, 8, 54, 'This was the case with the people of Pharaoh and those before them, who rejected the signs of their Lord and were destroyed for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as they were oppressors.'),

(1275, 9, 40, 'If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two.

(1295, 9, 60, 'Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain. God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(1296, 9, 61, 'There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: "He listens to everyone." Tell them: "He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe. For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment."'),
(1297, 9, 62, 'They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle.'),
(1298, 9, 63, 'Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever? And that is the worst disgrace.'),
(1299, 9, 64, 'The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say to them: "Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread."'),
(1300, 9, 65, 'But if you ask them, they will say: "We were only gossiping and jesting." You ask them: "Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?"'),
(1301, 9, 66, 'Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).'),
(1302, 9, 67, 'The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other. They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God). Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them. The hypocrites are indeed transgressors.'),
(1303, 9, 68, 'God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is sufficient for them: They have God\'s condemnation and lasting torment,'),
(1304, 9, 69, 'Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them. You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse. Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers.'),
(1305, 9, 70, 'Has not the account of those before them come to them, -- of the people of Noah and \'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed? Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves.'),
(1306, 9, 71, 'Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God will be merciful to them, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.'),
(1307, 9, 72, 'God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all. That will be happiness supreme.'),
(1308, 9, 73, 'Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly. Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!'),
(1309, 9, 74, 'They swear by God: "We never said this." But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.'),
(1310, 9, 75, 'Some of them made a covenant with God: "If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright."'),
(1311, 9, 76, 'But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away.'),

(1313, 9, 78, 'Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?'),
(1314, 9, 79, 'They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment.'),
(1315, 9, 80, 'Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way.'),
(1316, 9, 81, 'Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God\'s Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: "Do not go in this heat." Tell them: "The heat of Hell is far more intense." If only they had cared to instruct themselves!'),
(1317, 9, 82, 'So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done.'),
(1318, 9, 83, 'If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: "You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more. You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind."'),
(1319, 9, 84, 'Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die, nor stand to pray at their graves, for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet, and died transgressors.'),

(1321, 9, 86, 'Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): "Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet," the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: "Leave us with those who are left behind."'),
(1322, 9, 87, 'They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand.'),
(1323, 9, 88, 'But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him, and have fought wealth and soul (in the way of God), are blessed and will be successful.'),
(1324, 9, 89, 'God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water, where they will abide for ever. This will be the supreme triumph.'),
(1325, 9, 90, 'Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing. So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful.'),
(1326, 9, 91, 'No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind.'),
(1327, 9, 92, 'Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: "I cannot find any means of conveyance for you," and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage).'),

(1329, 9, 94, 'When you come back they will offer excuses to you. Tell them: "Make no excuses; we do not believe you. God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct. Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did."'),

(1332, 9, 97, 'The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy, and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God; yet God is aware of everything and is wise.'),
(1333, 9, 98, 'Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune. For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything.'),
(1334, 9, 99, 'Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet. This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind.'),
(1335, 9, 100, 'Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way. For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme.'),
(1336, 9, 101, 'Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites, and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy. You are not aware of them; We know them, and will punish them twice, and they will be sent to a harrowing doom.'),
(1337, 9, 102, 'But there are others who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil. It may be that God will accept their repentance, for God is forgiving and kind.'),
(1338, 9, 103, 'Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress, and invoke blessings upon them. Your blessings will surely bring them peace, for God hears all and knows everything.'),

(1340, 9, 105, 'Say to them: "Act. God will see your conduct, and so will His Apostle and the faithful; for you will in the end go back to Him, who knows the unknown and the known, who will tell you of what you were doing."'),
(1341, 9, 106, 'There are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of God. He may punish or pardon them, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(1342, 9, 107, 'There are those who built a mosque on opposition and disbelief, and to cause rifts among the faithful, and to serve as an outpost for those who have warred against God and His Apostle before this. Yet they will surely swear: "We had only meant well." But God is witness that they are liars.'),
(1343, 9, 108, 'Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it. There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure.'),
(1344, 9, 109, 'Is the man who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to God and the wish to seek His favour, better, or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water, which will collapse with him into the fire of Hell? But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust.'),
(1345, 9, 110, 'The edifice they have built will always fill their minds with perturbation (which will not cease) till their hearts are rent to pieces, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(1346, 9, 111, 'God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur\'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme.'),
(1347, 9, 112, 'To those who repent and pay homage, give praise and are devout, who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication, who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad, and keep to the limits set by God, announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful.'),
(1348, 9, 113, 'It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters, even though they may be their relatives, after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell.'),
(1349, 9, 114, 'As for Abraham\'s prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind.'),
(1350, 9, 115, 'God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything.'),
(1351, 9, 116, 'Verily God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He alone is the giver of life and death; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper.'),
(1352, 9, 117, 'God was kind to the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress. When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy, for He is compassionate and kind.'),
(1353, 9, 118, 'He has relented towards the three also (who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch) whose case was left undecided, and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them, and their lives were confined, and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God. So He softened towards them that they may repent; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful.'),
(1354, 9, 119, 'O believers, do not stray from the path of God, and be with those who are truthful.'),
(1355, 9, 120, 'It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour. Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste.'),
(1356, 9, 121, 'There is not a sum, large or small, that they spend, not a piece of land that they traverse (in the service of God) which is not put down in their favour, so that God could reward them for what they had done.'),
(1357, 9, 122, 'It is not possible for all believers to go out (to fight). So a part of each section (of the population) should go (to fight) in order that the others may acquire understanding of law and divinity, and warn their companions on return so that they may take heed for themselves.'),
(1358, 9, 123, 'O believers, fight the unbelievers around you, and let them realise that you are firm: Remember, God is with those who are pious and obedient to Him.'),
(1359, 9, 124, 'When a Surah is revealed some of them remark: "Whose faith among you has it increased?" It does increase the faith of those who believe, and they rejoice.'),
(1360, 9, 125, 'But it adds disbelief to disbelief for those whose hearts are filled with doubt, and they die disbelieving.'),
(1361, 9, 126, 'Do they not know that they are tried every year once or twice? Even then they do not repent and take heed.'),
(1362, 9, 127, 'Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other (so as to ask): "Is anyone looking at Us?" and then turn away. Indeed God has turned their hearts away (from the truth), for they cannot discern the law of heaven.'),
(1363, 9, 128, 'To you has come an Apostle from among you. Any sorrow that befalls you weighs upon him; He is eager for your happiness, full of concern for the faithful, compassionate and kind.'),
(1364, 9, 129, 'So, if they turn away, say to them: "God is sufficient for me. There is no God but He; I depend on Him alone, the Lord of the glorious Throne."');

And free those slaves you possess who wish to buy their freedom after a written undertaking, if you know they have some goodness, and give them out of the riches God has given you.

But if someone forces them, surely God (will forgive them) after their forced helplessness, for He is forgiving and kind.'),
(2825, 24, 34, 'We have sent down clear instructions to you, and illustrations from (the accounts) of those who have gone before you, and a warning for those who take heed for themselves.'),
(2826, 24, 35, 'God is the light of the heavens and the earth. The semblance of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass, the glass a glittering star as it were, lit with the oil of a blessed tree, the olive, neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil appears to light up even though fire touches it not, -- light upon light. God guides to His light whom He will. So does God advance precepts of wisdom for men, for God has knowledge of everything.'),
(2827, 24, 36, '(The light is lit) in houses of worship which God has allowed to be raised, and His name remembered in them. His praises are sung there morning and evening,'),

(2831, 24, 40, 'Or like darkness in a wide, wide sea, waves surging upon waves, with clouds overhanging, darkness on darkness. If you stretch your hand, you could hardly see it. For him whom God does not give any light, there is no light.'),
(2832, 24, 41, 'Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds on the wing, sing the praises of God. Each one knows its obligations and its duties, and God knows whatever they do.'),
(2833, 24, 42, 'For God\'s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and the returning is to God.'),
(2834, 24, 43, 'Have you not seen that God drives the clouds, then joins them together and puts them fold on fold. Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please. His lightning could snatch away their eyes.'),
(2835, 24, 44, 'It is God who alternates night and day. There is surely a lesson in this for men of sight.'),
(2836, 24, 45, 'God created every moving thing from water: One crawls on its belly, one walks on two legs, another moves on four. God creates whatsoever He will. Indeed God has power over everything.'),

(2842, 24, 51, 'The answer of the believers when they are called to God and His Apostle that he may judge between them, is: "We hear and obey." And they are the ones who will prosper.'),
(2843, 24, 52, 'Whoever obeys God and His Prophet, fears God and does his duty to Him, will surely find success.'),
(2844, 24, 53, 'They swear solemnly by God: "If you command us we shall go forth." Say: "Do not swear. What is wanted is obedience, as should be. God is certainly aware of what you do."'),
(2845, 24, 54, 'Say: "Obey God and obey the Apostle. If you turn away, then for him is his duty to fulfil, and for you the burden that you carry; yet if you obey him you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is to convey the message clearly.'),
(2846, 24, 55, 'God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them, and will establish their faith which He has chosen for them and change their fear into security. They will worship Me and not associate any one with Me. But those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates.'),
(2847, 24, 56, 'So observe your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey the Apostle so that you may be shown mercy.'),
(2848, 24, 57, 'Do not think that unbelievers will subvert (the authority of God) on earth. Their abode is Hell; and what an evil destination!'),
(2849, 24, 58, 'O you who believe, let your dependants and those who have not yet reached the age of puberty, ask permission (to enter your presence) on three occasions: Before the early morning prayer; when you disrobe for the mid-day siesta; and after prayer at night. These are the three occasions of dishabille for you. There is no harm if you or they visit one another at other times (without permission). God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(2850, 24, 59, 'When your children have reached the age of puberty, they should similarly ask your leave (for entering) as others did before them. God thus clearly explains His commands to you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise.'),
(2851, 24, 60, 'As for your women past the age of bearing children, who have no hope of marriage, there is no harm if they take off their outer garments, but in such a way that they do not display their charms; yet if they avoid this it would be better for them. God is all-hearing and all-knowing.'),
(2852, 24, 61, 'There is no harm if the blind, the lame, the sick, or you yourselves, eat in your own houses or the houses of your fathers, mothers, or your brothers\' houses, or those of your sisters, or your fathers\' brothers\' or sisters\', or your mothers\' brothers\' or sisters\', or in the houses whose care is entrusted to you, or the houses of your friends.'),
(2853, 24, 62, 'There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God\'s forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind.'),
(2854, 24, 63, 'Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously. So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.'),
(2855, 24, 64, 'Does not everything in the heavens and the earth belong to God? He surely knows what state you are in; and on the day they go back to Him. He will tell them what they used to do, for God has knowledge of everything.');

(3586, 33, 53, 'O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten, and do not stay on talking. This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God.'),

(3593, 33, 60, 'If the hypocrites and perverts, and the rumour-mongers of Madinah, do not desist even now, We shall rouse you against them, so they would not be able to live but a short time in the city with you.'),

(3665, 35, 5, 'O you people, the promise of God is true. So do not let the life of this world delude you, nor let that (arch) deceiver deceive you about God.'),
(3666, 35, 6, 'Satan is certainly your enemy, so hold him as a foe. He only calls his faction to be the residents of Hell.'),
(3667, 35, 7, 'For those who are unbelievers, there is severe punishment; but for those who believe and do the right is forgiveness and a great reward.'),
(3668, 35, 8, 'Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)? God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will. So do not waste away your self with grief for them. God is indeed cognisant of things they do.'),
(3669, 35, 9, 'It is God who sends the winds that raise the clouds. Then We drive the clouds towards the land that was dead, and restore the earth to life after it had died. So will be the Resurrection.'),
(3670, 35, 10, 'Whosoever desires honour (should remember) that all honour is with God. All good words ascend to Him, and all good deeds He exalts. As for those who are plotting evil, there is severe punishment for them, and their plots will be fruitless.'),
(3671, 35, 11, 'It is God who created you from dust, then from a sperm, then formed you into pairs. Neither does a female conceive nor gives birth without His knowledge; nor do the old grow older or become younger in years but in accordance with the law (of nature). Indeed the law of God works inevitably.'),
(3672, 35, 12, 'Alike are not two bodies of water: This one is sweet and fresh and pleasant to drink, and this one brine and bitter; yet you get fresh meat to eat from both, and take out ornaments to wear. You see how the ships churn through them so that you may seek of His bounty and, perhaps, give thanks.'),
(3673, 35, 13, 'He makes night run into day, the day run into night, and has harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs to its determined course. This is God your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those you invoke apart from Him are not masters even of the film on a date-palm stone.'),
(3674, 35, 14, 'You pray to them, but they do not hear your call; and even if they heard you, they could not answer your prayer; and on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your having worshipped them. None can acquaint you (with the reality) as He who is informed of everything.'),
(3675, 35, 15, 'O men, it is you who stand in need of God. As for God, He is above all need, worthy of praise.'),
(3676, 35, 16, 'He could take you away if He pleased and bring a new creation (in your place).'),
(3677, 35, 17, 'This is well within the power of God.'),
(3678, 35, 18, 'No one who carries a burden bears another\'s load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations. Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.'),
(3679, 35, 19, 'Equal are not the blind and those who can see,'),
(3680, 35, 20, 'Nor darkness and light,'),
(3681, 35, 21, 'Nor shade and heat of sunshine.'),
(3682, 35, 22, 'Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.'),
(3683, 35, 23, 'You are only a bearer of warnings.'),
(3684, 35, 24, 'We have sent you with the truth, to give glad tidings and to warn. Never has there been a community to which an admonisher was not sent.'),
(3685, 35, 25, 'If they call you a liar, so had those before them called their apostles liars, who had come to them with clear proofs, scriptures and the splendent Book.'),
(3686, 35, 26, 'So We seized the unbelievers. How great was the change I wrought in their condition then!'),
(3687, 35, 27, 'Do you not see how God sends water from the sky, then We produce fruits from it variegated in colour; and on mountains are tracts of red and white, in different shades and raven black.'),
(3688, 35, 28, 'And so are among men, beasts and cattle, different shades. Only those of His creatures fear God who have knowledge. Verily He is all-mighty and forgiving.'),
(3689, 35, 29, 'Surely those who read the Book of God, are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them in secret or openly, can hope for a commerce that will not decline,'),
(3690, 35, 30, 'So that He may reward them in full, and give them a greater increase by His grace. He is verily forgiving and rewarding.'),
(3691, 35, 31, 'What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, and proves (what has been sent) before it to be true. Verily God is informed of His creatures and sees everything.'),
(3692, 35, 32, 'So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God\'s will, which is the greatest blessing.'),
(3693, 35, 33, 'They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments.'),
(3694, 35, 34, 'They will say: "All praise be to God who has removed all care from us. Indeed our Lord is forgiving and rewarding,'),
(3695, 35, 35, 'Who has settled us by His grace in the mansions of eternal rest, where there is no labour for us, nor does weariness come upon us."'),
(3696, 35, 36, 'As for the unbelievers, there is the fire of Hell. It will neither consume them wholly that they should die, nor will its torment be lessened for them. That is how We requite the ungrateful.'),
(3697, 35, 37, 'There they will cry for help: "O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do." Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you? So now taste (the punishment). The iniquitous will have none to help them.'),
(3698, 35, 38, 'Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth. Indeed He knows what lies in the hearts of men.'),
(3699, 35, 39, 'He is the one who made you trustees on the earth. So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss.'),
(3700, 35, 40, 'Say: "Look at the compeers you invoke apart from God. Show me, what of the earth have they created, or what share have they in the heavens?" Or have We given them a Book whose testimony they possess? Not in the least. What the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit.'),
(3701, 35, 41, 'Verily God holds the heavens and the earth in position lest they deviate; and if they deviated there will be none to hold them in place, apart from Him He is sagacious and forgiving.'),
(3702, 35, 42, 'The unbelievers swore on oath emphatically that if an admonisher came to them they would be guided better than the other communities. But when the admonisher came to them their aversion for the truth increased,'),
(3703, 35, 43, 'As did their arrogance in the land, and their plotting of evil. But their evil plots will turn back on the plotters themselves. So can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people? You will not find any change in the law of God, nor will you find divine law mutable.'),
(3704, 35, 44, 'Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them, who were far more powerful, came about? There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat (the law of) God. He is all-knowing and all-powerful.'),
(3705, 35, 45, 'If God were to seize men for their doings, not a living being would be left upon the earth. But He gives them respite for a time ordained. When their time is come, surely God will keep (the interest of) His creatures in view.');

(But this was not done) so that God may admit into His favour whom He willed. If these (believers) had been separated from them, He would have inflicted a grievous punishment on the unbelievers.'),
