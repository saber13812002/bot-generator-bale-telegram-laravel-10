                'description' => '🤔 Weekly wonder 🤔 How can I fix bottlenecks in my supply chain with process automation?  

By examining the processes in your supply chain rather than just the surface level data, you can determine the cause of bottlenecks and fix them using process automation. 

🔎 Maintain a transparent workflow: Proactively maintain your workflows to provide visibility and clarity throughout all stages of the supply chain. This fixes bottlenecks and helps identify the root cause. 
⏩Create agile processes: Automation platforms provide an agile foundation to build your operations on, allowing for incremental changes without disrupting the overall output. 
⚙️Automate manual processes: Bottlenecks often occur when a task is sat with an individual who needs to manually complete an action before it can pass to the next stage. Automation speeds up this process. 
📊 Analyze your data: Every supply chain is unique. So, you need to learn from your own history and data. Integrating your workflows to pass information to BI dashboards allows you to gain an overview of data in real-time to identify bottlenecks. 

Fixing bottlenecks is the only way to keep your supply chain moving. Find out more: https://okt.to/pEfW3w',

Vendor management solutions help your business operate more effectively, quickly, and sustainably. It can also bring you a whole host of other benefits. 

👀 Greater visibility: Automation tracks every decision and can gain greater visibility of your vendors, which is key to reducing single-source dependencies that create huge problems during periods of disruption. 
☑️ Easier compliance: Automation enables a paper trail to aid audits, remind you of licensing expirations and helps avoid inaccurate data with a single point of entry. 
💰 Reduced costs: With automated procurement, you can flex your resources to your business needs. This helps reduce any unnecessary costs and over-ordering.  
🔛 Faster onboarding: Automating onboarding saves time and resources by reducing siloes and centralizing vendor master data. Plus, your vendors don’t have to spend time submitting various documents. 
📈Performance monitoring: Automated processes mean you can collect valuable performance data on outsourced resources and measure this against KPIs. 
📊Reporting and analytics: You can maintain a single source of truth business-wide by unifying all your vendor data in one place and synchronizing master data across systems.  
📃Optimized invoicing: Your vendor management system can take care of invoicing and payment processing.

                'description' => 'It was wonderful to be in Lagos, Nigeria this past week to give a keynote at the first annual ProcessMaker Nigerian Partner and Customer summit. We held the event at the Radisson Blu in Victoria Island and hosted close to 75 customers and partners over the two day event.   Thanks to my good friend and our Executive Director of Africa, Ed Ukaonu, and our Nigerian team Samuel Gbadebo, Jeremiah Davies, and Bamgboye Ayodele, BCS, MBA.   I would also like to give a special thanks to Rear Admiral Alison Madueke for his presence at the event.

ProcessMaker has experienced exponential growth in Africa over the past 12+ years since signing our first customer Guaranty Trust bank back in 2011.  I am forever grateful to the leadership of GTB for believing in our solution since the beginning.  Now, in Nigeria alone, 4/5 of the largest banks are  powered by the ProcessMaker business process automation solution.  ProcessMaker currently powers more than 30,000,000 cases per year thanks to these top tier banks in Africa. 

The African banking sector is one of the fastest moving, fastest growing, and most innovative banking sectors in the world today, and ProcessMaker is proud to be contributing to that speed of innovation.

At the event we were thrilled to showcase ProcessMaker’s latest release which includes ProcessMaker AI which can now build forms, scripts, and process models from simple text descriptions. In fact, ProcessMaker’s AI can now take a business analyst from a text description to an end-to-end running process in just a few minutes.

We also spent time introducing our customer\'s to our latest solution - ProcessMaker Process Intelligence.  Process Intelligence is a new ProcessMaker offering thanks to the acquisition of Workfellow which we announced a few weeks ago.  

I had not been to Nigeria in nearly six years due to a long COVID interruption. It was great to be back. I was reminded of the wonderful energy of Lagos, and the  good humor and incredible hospitality of Nigerians.  I am already looking forward to the event next year.  #bpm #workflowautomation #processintelligence #taskmining #processmining #idp #businessprocessmanagement #africa #innovateafrica #nigeria Fidelity Bank PLC Access Bank Plc Ecobank Cameroon Co-operative Bank of Kenya FSDH Merchant Bank Zenith Bank Plc UBA Group Heirs Technologies dipoleDIAMOND First Bank of Nigeria Ltd.

                'description' => '🤔 Weekly wonder 🤔 What are the top challenges for retail banks?

🙋♂️ Meeting customer expectations: The level of personalized service your customers expect today is dictated by the other brands they interact with.  
🏁 Outpacing the competition: The retail banking industry has never been so competitive. With banking no longer restricted by geography, your competition can come from anywhere.  
☑️ Meeting regulations: A core challenge for retail banks is keeping up with regulations and maintaining compliance.  
⚖️ Managing risk: Managing compliance and security risks effectively is essential for retail banking organizations to avoid financial and reputational damage. 
👔 Improving employee recruitment and retention: Could automation be the secret to attracting more employees – and keeping the ones you already have?  
💾 Combatting outdated technology: Legacy systems could be holding you back from growth and being able to serve your customers better. They’re costly to maintain and complicated to integrate.  
💰 Optimizing costs: Cutting costs while increasing revenue. The ultimate business challenge.  

Bizagi has helped many banks overcome these challenges with low-code automation. Find out more: https://okt.to/t8AY9c',
